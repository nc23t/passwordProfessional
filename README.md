  passwordProfessional

A simple, learning-focused CLI tool that **assesses password strength** and gives actionable feedback. This project is being built step-by-step to practice Python fundamentals (functions, modules, I/O, and simple scoring logic).

## Features 

- Prompts user for a password and prints feedback for:
  - Length quality
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Presence of numbers
- Scoring model: *0–40* with labels (`weak` / `ok` / `strong`).
