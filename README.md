  passwordProfessional

A simple, learning-focused CLI tool that **assesses password strength** and gives actionable feedback. This project is being built step-by-step to practice Python fundamentals (functions, modules, I/O, and simple scoring logic).

> Current status: interactive CLI skeleton with length and character checks in progress. Scoring + labels are being fleshed out.

---

## Features (in progress)

- Prompts user for a password and prints feedback for:
  - Length quality
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Presence of numbers
- Planned scoring model: *0–100* with labels (`weak` / `ok` / `strong`).
- Target “strong” profile (goal): *20+ characters*, at least *1 uppercase*, *1 number*, and *~3 special characters*.

## Installation

**Requirements**
- Python 3.9+ (any mainstream 3.x is fine)
